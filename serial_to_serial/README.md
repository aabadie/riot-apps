## Communicate between 2 UART interfaces

This is a basic example that shows a way to communicate between 2 UART interfaces.

This example should show you how to use UART interfaces.

You need at least 3 UART interfaces to make it work :
* UART0 (PC terminal).
* UART2 can be connected to any serial device (Bluetooth, Serial to USB, etc).

UARTs are initialize with a baudrate of 9600.
